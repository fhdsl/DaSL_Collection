## EdTech Software

The following are tools and software we've designed to make training more streamlined and reproducible. They have the `edtech-software` tag.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
source("scripts/render_collection.R")
DT::datatable(
  make_collection_table(kable = FALSE, include = "edtech-software"), # must include "edtech-software" tag from github
  escape = FALSE,
  # Make cell values html enabled
  rownames = FALSE,
  # Remove 1, 2, 3 labels
  options = list(
    autowidth = TRUE,
    search = list(regex = TRUE),
    pageLength = 100,
    # Show 100 results
    dom = 'ft',
    # Don't allow to change how many results are displayed
    # dom = "Qlfrtip",
    # searchBuilder = TRUE,
    search = list(return = TRUE)
  )
)
```
