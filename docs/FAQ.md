# FAQ

## What is the DaSL Collection?

DaSL Collection uses the GitHub API to gather repositories that we have worked on. It renders the table in a markdown-readable format.

## How can I add my new course/content to the Collection?

The following are needed to list your repository in the collection:

- Your repository must be created under the `jhudsl` or `fhdsl` organizations. For repositories under other organizations, you can fork the repository into the `jhudsl` or `fhdsl` organizations. [Example](https://github.com/fhdsl/Data-Wrangling)
- Your repository "code" tab must have a **description**, **homepage**, and **topic tags** filled out in the "About" section on the righthand side. 
- Your repository must be set to **public**.
- Your repository must have at least one of three tags: `course` (general purpose courses), `hutch-course` (Fred Hutch specific courses), or `edtech-software`. If you feel there is another applicable category that should be listed, please reach out to [Ava](https://github.com/avahoffman).

## How often is the Collection updated?

The collection is rendered on Sundays between 3am and 5am EST.

## How do I edit **description**, **homepage**, and **topics**?

### Where to edit

Start by clicking the gear button on the top right of the repository page on GitHub next to "About".

### Edit repository homepage

Make sure you link to the website where your course is being rendered. For example, this repository links to <https://jhudatascience.org/AnVIL_Book_Instructor_Guide>.

Finally, you should add any relevant topics, as they will be listed in the Collection table!
