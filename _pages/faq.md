# What is the DaSL Collection?

DaSL Collection uses the Github API to gather repositories that we have worked on. It renders the table in a markdown-readable format.

# What is needed to list my repository?

The Collection workflow uses three important things to add courses to the DaSL Collection. These are the repository **description**, **homepage**, and **topics** tags. Repositories must be set to public to be listed in the Collection.

# How often is the Collection updated?

The collection is rendered nightly between 3am and 5am EST.

# How can I add my new course/content to the Collection?

Your repository must be created under the jhudsl, fhdsl, or datatrail-jhu organizations and meet the above criteria. For more information see the [FAQ](https://hutchdatascience.org/DaSL_Collection/faq.html) tab.

For repositories under other organizations, you can fork the repository into the jhudsl or fhdsl organizations. [Example](https://github.com/fhdsl/Data-Wrangling)

# I want to use the raw Collection data!

You can use the following link:

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fhdsl/DaSL_Collection/main/resources/collection.tsv>

# How do I edit **description**, **homepage**, and **topics**?

## Where to edit

Start by clicking the gear button on the top right of the repository page on GitHub next to "About".

## Edit repository description

Enter a concise description, for example "A guide for instructors using AnVIL for workshops, lessons, or courses."

## Edit repository homepage

Make sure you link to the website where your course is being rendered. For example, this repository links to <https://jhudatascience.org/AnVIL_Book_Instructor_Guide>.

Finally, you should add any relevant topics, as they will be listed in the Collection table!
