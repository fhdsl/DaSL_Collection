The Collection workflow uses three important things to add your course to the DaSL Collection. These are the repository **description**, **homepage**, and **topics** tags. Repositories must be set to public to be listed in the Collection.

### (1) Where to edit

Start by clicking the gear button on the top right of the repository page on GitHub next to "About".

### (2) Repository Description

Enter a concise description, for example "A guide for instructors using AnVIL for workshops, lessons, or courses."

### (3) Repository Homepage

Make sure you link to the website where your course is being rendered. For example, this repository links to <https://jhudatascience.org/AnVIL_Book_Instructor_Guide>.

### (4) Repository Topics

Finally, you should add any relevant topics, as they will be listed in the Collection table!
